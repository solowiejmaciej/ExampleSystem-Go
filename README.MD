# Go Microservice System

## Description

This is a basic microservice system written in Go. It allows users to sign up and log in. The system uses JWT tokens for authentication, Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for message queuing, Docker Compose for managing multi-container Docker applications, and PostgreSQL for the database.
